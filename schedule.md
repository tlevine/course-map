Class will take place from 1-6PM M-F. We'll try to schedule any lectures from 4-6PM. If any facilitators are available, there may also be facilitators around from 6-9PM.

The first week of the course (Jan. 5-9) will be informal and optional. We will help people get set up with Linux and get started with basic concepts. Even though we'll be focusing on basics, everyone is encouraged to come anyway! And if you're a complete beginner, please try to make it for as much of this first week as possible.

The "formal" school part will begin the second week and run until the end of the month (Jan. 12-30). After getting folks set up with their environment and working on some fundamentals during the first week of the course, we'll encourage everyone to either have their own project or have something to work on (like a node school lesson). The first part of class every day will be spent working on projects and [node school lessons](http://nodeschool.io), collaborating with other participants and with facilitators available to help answer questions. Lectures will get scheduled in the 4-6PM part of class. People are welcome to stay past 6PM, but we won't be able to guarantee that facilitators will be there (of course, there may end up being facilitators available at that time, but it's not guaranteed!). Also, participants can work at [sudo](http://sudoroom.org) whenever they want outside of "official" class time. Even if facilitators aren't around, your classmates are a great resource - together you can solve many problems!

Finally, we will hopefully have a weekly show-and-tell that will be open to other Sudoers where we'll share what we learned and worked on that week. This will be low-stress and for the purpose of getting feedback on our work, helping get through difficult spots, and sharing tricks you learn. 

As we get closer to January, we'll start posting dates for specific lectures.

If you want to get a head start, you can [familiarize yourself with BASH](http://pgbovine.net/command-line-tutorial.htm) (try to get comfortable navigating your computer with the command line), learn the basics of [HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web), and start [learning javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). You can also work on [node school lessons](http://nodeschool.io). Finally, it will help a lot if you come up with some potential projects to work on during the course. Not sure what you'd like to make? Look around you! You know what kinds of things computers can do! You see the kinds of things there are on the internet! Think of some fun things you'd like to make (games? video effects? music? something else?) and if you want, start to learn how some of those things get made.
