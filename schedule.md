Class will take place 1-6PM M-F. We will try to schedule all lectures in the evening, 4-6PM. When available, there may also be facilitators and lectures at night, 6-9PM.

The first week of the course (Jan. 5-9) will be informal and optional. We will help people get set up with Linux and get started with basic concepts. If you're a complete beginner, please try to make as much of this first week as possible. If you're not a beginner, we encourage you to come as well - it will be a great time to start working on projects and develop a learning plan if you have a specific learning goal.

The "formal" sessions will begin the second week and run until the end of the month (Jan. 12-30). By this point, you should have your own project andor work on things like [node school lessons](http://nodeschool.io). The first part of class every day will be spent working on projects and node school lessons and collaborating with other participants.  Facilitators, aka Wizards, will be available to answer your questions with riddles, provide guidance, and reveal secrets. 

Lectures will be scheduled in the 4-6PM hours of class. People are welcome to stay past 6PM, but we won't be able to guarantee that Wizards will be there. There may end up being facilitators available at that time, but it's not guaranteed!  Also, participants can work at [sudo](http://sudoroom.org) whenever they want outside of "official" class time. Your classmates are a great resource - together you can solve many problems!

Finally, we will hopefully have a weekly show-and-tell that will be open to other Sudoers, during which the we will share what cyber wizardry we learned. This will be very informal.  The goal is to get feedback on your work, help get through difficulties (bugs!), and share tricks you have learned. 

As we get closer to January, we'll post dates for specific lectures, and information about our resident Wizards.

If you want to get a head start, you can [familiarize yourself with BASH](http://pgbovine.net/command-line-tutorial.htm) (try to get comfortable navigating your computer with typed commands), learn the basics of [HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web), and start [learning javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). You can also work on [node school lessons](http://nodeschool.io). Finally, it will help a lot if you come up with some potential projects to work on during the course. Not sure what you'd like to make? Look around you! You know what kinds of things computers can do! You see the kinds of things there are on the internet! Think of some fun things you'd like to make (games? video effects? music? something else?) and if you want, start to learn how some of those things get made.
