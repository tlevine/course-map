Until the real calendar is up, use this page to volunteer for giving a presentation (along with a workshop afterwards ideally) and to volunteer to mentor for blocks of time. Right now the plan is to run weekdays from January 5th through 30th, but we can also have weekend events if that suits volunteer schedules better. Tuesday evenings will be show and tell night.

You can also volunteer to help facilitate a workshop/lesson that has already been posted. Lectures should ideally come accompanied with lecture notes and a workshop peer-learning section afterward building mini projects based on the topics covered in the lesson. We'll link to all the course materials and student projects from the website when everything is finished.

If you come up with a new topic that you think you can give to a relatively beginner group, please add it to the [course map](course map).

I think it makes sense for orientation activities (introducing the format, installing linux) to be on Jan 5th and rolling orientation for any stragglers.

If you can plan this far in advance, dates for your presentation and mentoring would be good to make sure we'll have adequate calendar coverage to make sure CWI is properly intensive. Also note that as CWI progresses students will become increasingly capable, so we should put more introductory topics toward the beginning and topics that require more background that is covered in other lectures toward the end. Bonus points for explicitly listing pre-requisites.

# substack

I would like to give workshops and presentations about:

* basics of unix (pre-requisite: a working linux or mac osx) *jan 6*
* frontend javascript with npm modules and browserify (pre-requisite: basic javascript, html) *jan 15*
* svg (pre-requisite: basic javascript, html. soft pre-req on browserify/npm) *jan 21*
* building a website with leveldb (pre-requisite: node, unix, html) *jan 23*

and if nobody else wants to, I think it would be really good to have a basic data structure / light intro to cs topics workshop/lecture.

Office hours:

* Monday, Thursday: 13:00 to 18:00

and then Tuesday I'll also be around to help with show and tell. Possibly I'll be around more than this to fill in any gaps.

I am flexible about dates so if people want to swap I can probably accomodate.

#thealphanerd

I would like to give workshop / presentations about music technology, and perhaps help co-ordinate / curate other individuals contributing in that space to come talk / teach as well.  Topics and workshops I am interested in presenting include

* introduction to signal processing (and western music theory to an extent)
* introduction to audio graphs / unit generators
* introduction to arduino and sensors (johnny five)
* introduction to embedded linux (raspi perhaps?)
* making an instrument

#mk30

I'm happy to be available for office hours at any time, but I won't be super useful on many topics. I will, of course, be happy to figure problems out with people as they occur.

Also I feel comfortable helping people get set up with their environments and answering basic questions ("what is a server?" etc.) in the first week.

Still thinking about what workshops I might be able to give, but here are some ideas I have so far:

* ssh (prereq: working linux or mac osx)
* irc/irssi (prereq: working linux or mac osx)
* setting up a basic web server (prereq: working linux or mac osx, ssh)
* solving problems and getting help (searching for info, asking on irc, etc.) (no prereqs, but it helps if you have some problems that need solving)
