Until the real calendar is up, use this page to volunteer for giving a presentation (along with a workshop afterwards ideally) and to volunteer to mentor for blocks of time. Right now the plan is to run weekdays from January 5th through 30th, but we can also have weekend events if that suits volunteer schedules better. Tuesday evenings will be show and tell night.

You can also volunteer to help facilitate a workshop/lesson that has already been posted. Lectures should ideally come accompanied with lecture notes and a workshop peer-learning section afterward building mini projects based on the topics covered in the lesson. We'll link to all the course materials and student projects from the website when everything is finished.

If you come up with a new topic that you think you can give to a relatively beginner group, please add it to the [course map](course map).

I think it makes sense for orientation activities (introducing the format, installing linux) to be on Jan 5th and rolling orientation for any stragglers.

If you can plan this far in advance, dates for your presentation and mentoring would be good to make sure we'll have adequate calendar coverage to make sure CWI is properly intensive. Also note that as CWI progresses students will become increasingly capable, so we should put more introductory topics toward the beginning and topics that require more background that is covered in other lectures toward the end. Bonus points for explicitly listing pre-requisites.

# substack

I would like to give workshops and presentations about:

* basics of unix (pre-requisite: a working linux or mac osx) *jan 6*
* frontend javascript with npm modules and browserify (pre-requisite: basic javascript, html) *jan 15*
* svg (pre-requisite: basic javascript, html. soft pre-req on browserify/npm) *jan 21*
* building a website with leveldb (pre-requisite: node, unix, html) *jan 23*

and if nobody else wants to, I think it would be really good to have a basic data structure / light intro to cs topics workshop/lecture.

Office hours:

* Monday, Thursday: 13:00 to 18:00

and then Tuesday I'll also be around to help with show and tell. Possibly I'll be around more than this to fill in any gaps.

I am flexible about dates so if people want to swap I can probably accommodate.

#thealphanerd

I would like to give workshop / presentations about music technology, and perhaps help co-ordinate / curate other individuals contributing in that space to come talk / teach as well.  Topics and workshops I am interested in presenting include

* introduction to signal processing (and western music theory to an extent)
* introduction to audio graphs / unit generators
* introduction to arduino and sensors (johnny five)
* introduction to embedded linux (raspi perhaps?)
* making an instrument

#mk30

I'm happy to be available for office hours at any time, but I won't be super useful on many topics. I will, of course, be happy to figure problems out with people as they occur.

Also I feel comfortable helping people get set up with their environments and answering basic questions ("what is a server?" etc.) in the first week.

Still thinking about what workshops I might be able to give, but here are some ideas I have so far:

* ssh (prereq: working linux or mac osx)
* irc/irssi (prereq: working linux or mac osx)
* setting up a basic web server (prereq: working linux or mac osx, ssh)
* using a web api (with the [localwiki api](https://localwiki.org/main/API_Documentation) as an example) (prereqs: working linux or mac osx, bash, node)
* solving problems and getting help (searching for info, asking on irc, etc.) (no prereqs, but it helps if you have some problems that need solving)

#nandxor

I would certainly like to volunteer in support-capacity during Saturday workshops.

Here are a couple workshops I can do that are from/related to the main list:

* intro to git (prereq: working linux, mac osx, or git-bash for windows) 
* three.js and webgl (prereq: javascript, and front-end)


#eunoia

I can volunteer for office hours during the day. 

#morenoh149

I can volunteer most any days. I have a very flexible schedule but can not dedicate more than ~20h/week. I have taught previously at http://www.hackercodingacademy.com/ (defunct) so that experience may help.

#rodriguezartav

I invented a CLI that makes it really easy to build NPM based HTML5-JS Apps. We have tried it with high-school students no prior experience, it works with one 1h lecture + a 2h workshop. 

It's based on browserify, and it has a Convention over Configuration approach. It works out of the box, sample apps, develop in local server, upload preview, final deploy to S3. No setup required, uses free & open infrastructure

I am born and based in Costa Rica, travel to SF ofter. I would like get involved with lectures + workshop. Office Hours too.

#QuincyLarson

I can volunteer for office hours the week of Jan 12 - 16. I could potentially lead workshops on the following: debugging and the Chrome DevTools; Express.js; and your aformentioned "solving problems and getting help" course.

I'm running a free online bootcamp similar to this (FreeCodeCamp.com) and "solving problems and getting help" has definitely come up as a critical skill.

Some example topics are:

* Learn to build an HTML5 App using Javascript. ( Probably similar to substack's but using a CLI, download samples from repository, change, and upload in 5 minutes; It's iteration from there on. )

* Adaptive Apps - Build HTML5 Apps that Adapts to Mobile, Tablet and Desktop. Building components component based apps.

* Introduction to Data & API's, reading data from simple data sources and sending data to simple API's like Google Docs or Parse for example

#Rudimental

I can volunteer for mentoring/office hours Monday and Thursdays. I could potentially lead workshops on the following:

* JavaScript Fundamentals (making sure people get the content of CodeSchool's JavaScript courses 1-3)

* Introduction to Underscore.js

#SteveSGill

I can volunteer for mentoring/office hours Wednesdays and possibly more in the evenings. I could potentially lead a workshop on:

* intro to Apache Cordova & developing mobile apps(prereq: node, unix, html, JS) Late Jan (28th?)

#zamfi

I'd love to do a session on "how the internet works". It's a fun little interactive course that covers the basics of IP, routing, DNS, TCP, clients and servers (including web, email, etc.), ports, SSL, ethernet, wifi, etc., and tools for using and exploring those. 

People often ask really great questions and we can get really deep into specific points of interest for individual folks, but in general it's just a really fun way to look at what "being on the internet" really means, how nodes are all connected, what the speed of light means for ping times, stuff like that. So I'd propose:

* How the Internet works: nodes, names, numbers, streams and everything in between. (Prerequisites: computer running a command line.) Early January -- could be useful intro before people start writing web apps. (But I may be out of town Jan 5 & 6.)

So many possibilities...

* [Algorithm games](http://thomaslevine.com/!/real-world-algorithms/)
* Data structure games, like
    [bits](http://thomaslevine.com/!/bits/) and
    [lists](http://thomaslevine.com/!/linked-lists/)
* [Command line things](http://thomaslevine.com/!/switching-to-command-line/)
* [Reading PDF files](http://thomaslevine.com/!/parsing-pdfs)

[More here](http://thomaslevine.com/learn/)

The main concern for my availability is whether I'll be in Oakland in
January. I can [move easily](http://thomaslevine.com/stuff/), but I don't
like looking for apartments; does anyone know anyone who is looking for
a roommate in January?

And [this is how I think about teaching](http://thomaslevine.com/!/about/#teaching).

I plan on attending the Institute January 12 through the 30th. I'm willing to facilitate anytime and give talks on basic programming constructs, SQL, HTML, CSS, user interface design.
